🌧️ Cloudburst Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Cloudbursts are sudden and intense rainfall events that cause flash floods, landslides, and severe infrastructure damage.
This project uses Machine Learning (Decision Tree Algorithm) to predict cloudburst events using historical weather data, satellite imagery, and meteorological parameters.

The model achieved 76.8% accuracy, demonstrating strong potential for real-world forecasting applications.
